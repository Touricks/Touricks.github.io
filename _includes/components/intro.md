I am a graduate student at Georgia Tech, having graduated University of Waterloo. I excel in data analysis and full-stack development.

In the data science field, I have completed two research projects focused on bioinformatics in past experience. My first project was as a data analyst, responsible for extracting raw data from experiments and predicting potential aptamers; and the second was as a data scientist, responsible for developing a DL model to predict the most likely mutation for specific proteins. In these roles, I specialized in both frontend and backend development, crafting comprehensive web applications that enhance user experience and operational efficiency.

In the full-stack development field, I have completed three projects, with details attached in my resume.
My research interests lie in the field of human-computer interaction. During my time at Arizona State University, I was a member of the Birth Lab, where I engaged in cutting-edge research focused on designing, constructing, and evaluating magnetic robots for tissue resection within the human gastrointestinal tract.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I am passionate about Latin dance, an activity that allows me to express creativity and maintain physical fitness. I also enjoy skiing, which not only challenges me but also provides a thrilling way to experience the great outdoors.

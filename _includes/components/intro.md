I am a graduate student pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, with dual expertise in data science and full-stack development.

In the data science domain, I have led two bioinformatics research projects:

1. Extracted raw experimental data to engineer features and predict potential aptamers;
2. Developed a deep learning model to forecast likely protein mutations.

In full-stack development, I have delivered three end-to-end projects:

1. An online house rental platform built on Spring Boot microservices and PostgreSQL
2. A Twitch video search and recommendation system using Spring Data JDBC with AWS RDS MySQL, and OpenFeign calls to the Twitch API
3. A web-based Q&A AI agent platform combining Django backend and React frontend, integrated with OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo via LangChain

Outside of my professional pursuits, I am passionate about tennis and skiing.

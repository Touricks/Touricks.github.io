https://app.laicode.io/app/problem/139?plan=3
Given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer number. Find the maximum possible sum **from any node to any node (the start node and the end node can be the same).**

**Assumptions**

- ​The root of the given binary tree is not null

**Examples**

-1

/ \

2 11

/ \

6 -14

one example of paths could be -14 -> 11 -> -1 -> 2

another example could be the node 11 itself

The maximum path sum in the above binary tree is 6 + 11 + (-1) + 2 = 18

**How is the binary tree represented?**

We use the level order traversal sequence with a special symbol "#" denoting the null node.
